## 📝 ReactJS Assignment: Personal Contact Card App

### 🎯 Objective:

Build a simple Personal Contact Card App that allows users to input and display their contact information. This project will help you practice using components, props, state, and forms in React.


### 📚 Concepts Covered:

* Functional Components
* Props
* useState Hook
* Handling Forms & Events


### Requirements:

#### 1. App Structure

Create the following components:

* `App` – Main component (manages state).
* `ContactForm` – Form to enter contact info.
* `ContactCard` – Displays contact info using props.

#### 2. Contact Form Functionality

Create a form with these input fields:

* Full Name
* Email
* Phone Number

When the form is submitted:

* Save the data in the state (in the `App` component).
* Pass the data as props to the `ContactCard` component to display it.

#### 3. ContactCard Display

Display the user’s contact info neatly inside a card-style UI (basic styling with CSS or inline styles is fine).



### Expected Outcome:

A working single-page React app where:

* A user can enter their name, email, and phone.
* On submission, the details appear in a styled card below the form.
* The form clears after submission (optional).


### Hints:

* Use `useState` for form values and submitted data.
* Use props to pass submitted data from `App` to `ContactCard`.
* Use basic styling with a border or shadow to make the contact card distinct.
